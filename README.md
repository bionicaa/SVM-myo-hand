Linear SVM Classifier

Run steps 1, 3, 4 to run and visualize the fitted SVM model.
Run step 9 to clear workspace.
Run steps 1, 2, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 to run and visualize new data prediction...
and execute motor function. 

Program creates a linear SVM that classifies new objects by obtaining 
the force sensor output voltage and inputted weight. When the EMG signal exceeds
the threshold, the motor activates. For Soft objects, the motor turns 90-degrees. 
For Hard objects, the motor turns 180-degrees.
